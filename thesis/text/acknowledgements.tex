I would like to thank my supervisor, doc. Ing. Jiří Kléma, Ph.D., for giving me
the opportunity to work on this interesting and valuable project and for all
his support and guidance.

I would also like to thank Ing. Anh Vu Le for providing me with a lot of
valuable data and insights into an existing intron detection pipeline based on
support vector machines.

In addition, I would like to thank my wife who supported me during the
difficult times.
