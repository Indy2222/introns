%%%%% SELECT YOUR DRAFT OPTIONS
% Three options going on here; use in any combination. But remember to turn the
% first two off before generating a PDF to send to the printer!

% This adds a "DRAFT" footer to every normal page. (The first page of each
% chapter is not a "normal" page.)
% \fancyfoot[C]{\emph{DRAFT Printed on \today}}

% This highlights (in blue) corrections marked with (for words)
% \mccorrect{blah} or (for whole paragraphs)
% \begin{mccorrection} ... \end{mccorrection}. This can be useful for sending a
% PDF of your corrected thesis to your examiners for review. Turn it off, and
% the blue disappears.
\correctionstrue


%%%%% BIBLIOGRAPHY SETUP
% Note that your bibliography will require some tweaking depending on your
% department, preferred format, etc. The options included below are just very
% basic "sciencey" and "humanitiesey" options to get started. If you've not
% used LaTeX before, I recommend reading a little about biblatex/biber and
% getting started with it. If you're already a LaTeX pro and are used to natbib
% or something, modify as necessary. Either way, you'll have to choose and
% configure an appropriate bibliography format...

% The science-type option: numerical in-text citation with references in order
% of appearance.
\usepackage[style=numeric-comp, sorting=none, backend=biber, doi=false, isbn=false]{biblatex}
\newcommand*{\bibtitle}{References}

\usepackage{fancyvrb}
\usepackage{longtable}
\usepackage{pdfpages}
\usepackage{xcolor}

\usepackage{mathtools}
\DeclarePairedDelimiter\ceil{\lceil}{\rceil}

% This makes the bibliography left-aligned (not 'justified') and slightly smaller font.
\renewcommand*{\bibfont}{\raggedright\small}

% Change this to the name of your .bib file (usually exported from a citation
% manager like Zotero or EndNote).
\addbibresource{references.bib}


% Uncomment this if you want equation numbers per section (2.3.12), instead of
% per chapter (2.18):
% \numberwithin{equation}{subsection}


%%%%% THESIS / TITLE PAGE INFORMATION
% Everybody needs to complete the following:
\title{Automatic Intron Detection in Metagenomes Using Neural Networks}
\author{Bc. Martin Indra}
\college{Faculty of Electrical Engineering}


% Uncomment the following line if your degree also includes exams (eg most masters):
%\renewcommand{\submittedtext}{Submitted in partial completion of the}
% Your full degree name.  (But remember that DPhils aren't "in" anything.  They're just DPhils.)
% \degree{Master of Science}
% Term and year of submission, or date if your board requires (eg most masters)
\degreedate{Winter Term 2020/2021}


%%%%% YOUR OWN PERSONAL MACROS

%%%%% THE ACTUAL DOCUMENT STARTS HERE
\begin{document}

%%%%% CHOOSE YOUR LINE SPACING HERE
% This is the official option.  Use it for your submission copy and library copy:
\setlength{\textbaselineskip}{22pt plus2pt}
% This is closer spacing (about 1.5-spaced) that you might prefer for your personal copies:
%\setlength{\textbaselineskip}{18pt plus2pt minus1pt}

% You can set the spacing here for the roman-numbered pages (acknowledgements, table of contents, etc.)
\setlength{\frontmatterbaselineskip}{17pt plus1pt minus1pt}

% Leave this line alone; it gets things started for the real document.
\setlength{\baselineskip}{\textbaselineskip}


%%%%% CHOOSE YOUR SECTION NUMBERING DEPTH HERE
% You have two choices. First, how far down are sections numbered? (Below that,
% they're named but don't get numbers.) Second, what level of section appears
% in the table of contents? These don't have to match: you can have numbered
% sections that don't show up in the ToC, or unnumbered sections that do.
% Throughout, 0 = chapter; 1 = section; 2 = subsection; 3 = subsubsection, 4 =
% paragraph...

% The level that gets a number:
\setcounter{secnumdepth}{2}
% The level that shows up in the ToC:
\setcounter{tocdepth}{2}

% JEM: Pages are roman numbered from here, though page numbers are invisible
% until ToC. This is in keeping with most typesetting conventions.
\begin{romanpages}

% Title page is created here
\maketitle

%%%%% DEDICATION -- If you'd like one, un-comment the following.
%\begin{dedication}
%This thesis is dedicated to\\
%someone\\
%for some special reason\\
%\end{dedication}

%%%%% ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
\begin{acknowledgements}
  \input{text/acknowledgements}
\end{acknowledgements}

%%%%% ABSTRACT -- Nothing to do here except comment out if you don't want it.
\begin{abstract}
  \input{text/abstract}
\end{abstract}

  \thispagestyle{empty}
  \pagestyle{empty}
  \setlength{\baselineskip}{\frontmatterbaselineskip}
\end{alwayssingle}

%%%%% MINI TABLES
% This lays the groundwork for per-chapter, mini tables of contents. Comment
% the following line (and remove \minitoc from the chapter files) if you don't
% want this. Un-comment either of the next two lines if you want a per-chapter
% list of figures or tables.
\dominitoc % include a mini table of contents
%\dominilof  % include a mini list of figures
%\dominilot  % include a mini list of tables

% This aligns the bottom of the text of each page. It generally makes things
% look better.
\flushbottom

% This is where the whole-document ToC appears:
\tableofcontents

\listoffigures
\mtcaddchapter
% \mtcaddchapter is needed when adding a non-chapter (but chapter-like) entity
% to avoid confusing minitoc

% Uncomment to generate a list of tables:
%\listoftables
%	\mtcaddchapter

%%%%% LIST OF ABBREVIATIONS
% This example includes a list of abbreviations. Look at text/abbreviations.tex
% to see how that file is formatted. The template can handle any kind of list
% though, so this might be a good place for a glossary, etc.
\include{text/abbreviations}

% The Roman pages, like the Roman Empire, must come to its inevitable close.
\end{romanpages}


%%%%% CHAPTERS

\include{text/intro}
\include{text/background}

\include{text/current-research}
\include{text/data}

%% APPENDICES
% Starts lettered appendices, adds a heading in table of contents, and adds a
% page that just says "Appendices" to signal the end of your main text.
% \startappendices
